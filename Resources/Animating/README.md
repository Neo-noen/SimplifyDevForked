# Intro
Have you ever tried making a game as a scripter and REALLY lacked the animations needed?
And does the normal Roblox animator feel too difficult to learn, that nothing turns out good? Not even template animations?
**(Of course, getting animators for a game is still useful, but)**

Here are some resources for animating in Blender!
(Now, don't worry. Blender is not as scary as it may seem)


# The Tools You Will Need:
### A Roblox Plugin for IMPORTING Blender Animations:

### A Blender Addon for EXPLORTING Blender Animations into Roblox:

Installation Process:
1. Copy the whole pastebin file, paste it into a new file, calling it something like "BlenderRobloxExporter.py". I suggest keeping it in a safe place, such as ".../Documents/MyStuff/Blender/Addons" (what I have)
2. In blender, go to Edit > Preferences. In there open "Add-ons"
3. Click on that arrow down icon, and press "Install from Disk" and select that .py file.

### A Rig for Blender Animation:
You don't have to worry about setting anything up, rather just start animating!
You can get the template R6 Rig [here](https://github.com/IcKon/SimplifyDev/blob/main/Resources/Animating/RobloxRigTemplate.zip) (the zip provided next to the README file), containing the Rig and a Texture for a clearer animating process (or follow what's written in [the post](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/blender-rig-exporteranimation-importer/34729) for an R15/custom rig)


# The Animating Process
### Start Animating
_Note: You shouldn't worry about it if you opened the provided .blend file from a new. You should be all ready to animate_
Ensure before you start animating (have the "Animation" tab selected), you have the rig's Armature selected. That is (from my understanding) the Animator Object.


### Uhhh
Yeah, that's all you get for now. I will try adding more tips here some time in the future. From now on, learning blender,
