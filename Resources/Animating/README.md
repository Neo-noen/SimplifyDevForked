Have you ever tried making a game as a scripter and REALLY lacked the animations needed?
And does the normal Roblox animator feel too difficult to learn, that nothing turns out good? Not even template animations?
**(Of course, getting animators for a game is still useful, but)**

Here are some resources for animating in Blender!
(Now, don't worry. Blender is not as scary as it may seem)

# The Tools You Will Need:
### A Roblox Plugin for IMPORTING Blender Animations:

### A Blender Addon for EXPLORTING Blender Animations into Roblox:

Installation Process:
1. Copy the whole pastebin file, paste it into a new file, calling it something like "BlenderRobloxExporter.py". I suggest keeping it in a safe place, such as ".../Documents/MyStuff/Blender/Addons" (what I have)
2. In blender, go to Edit > Preferences. In there open "Add-ons"
3. Click on that arrow down icon, and press "Install from Disk" and select that .py file.

### A Rig for Blender Animation:
To be added soon. Asking for usage permission...
