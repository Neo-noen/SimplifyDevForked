# SimplifyDev
A Github Repository made for our SimplifyDev Roblox Group

Our main goal is to provide mainly Free Tools for Roblox Development.
Our Modules are targeted towards people trying to make simple projects or if they are fresh new beginners, and our Plugins are targeted towards anyone, with its goal being Simple (hence the name).

For news about the development and new publishes, be sure to join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/EChnxk8kWf)!
We also try to post fun facts and quizzes about coding.

To show support it some other way (though just joining the server is more than enough), a star for this repo would highly appreciate, giving us more motivation to work further on things for you guys.
